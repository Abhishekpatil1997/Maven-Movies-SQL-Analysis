# Maven Movies SQL Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the database from Maven Movies, a fictional DVD rental business. The key goals are to:
- Understand the structure of the mavenmovies database encompassing 16 tables
- Develop SQL queries to extract insights across business areas - staff, inventory, customers, transactions
- Present findings to demonstrate proficiency in SQL analytics
